# wats4000-final-project

> A Vue.js project

This project for the WATS 4000-Basic WebApps Class at Seattle University, we were asked to completed the following requirements.

The following requirements must be met in order to successfully complete this assignment.

Utilize a JavaScript framework to build a single page application.
    At least two URLs in the application.
    At least one call to a data API.
    Use some form of user input to customize the API request.
    At least one feature designed to enhance the user experience (e.g. messaging, animation, local caching of data, etc.)
    Make sensible and conventional use of the features of the framework (templates, routing, etc.)
Implement some form of dependency management (Webpack, Bower, Browserify, etc.).
Implement some form of file optimization (CSS/JS minification, file versioning, etc.)
Implement deployment scripts that allow easy deployment of built code to the public web.
Use a convenient development server and setup for building the website.
Document how to set up the project for development in your README file.
Document how to deploy the site to production servers in your README file.
Provide good comments to help other developers better understand your application.

This is the result of these requirements and stuck with the basic ideas. This webapp is a Star Wars webapp with knowledge of different aspects of the app. There are four urls to this app. The first is a homepage with a welcome and email sign up. The next three pages are knowledge on Star Wars character, starships and planets.

## Build Setup and Deployment

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
